</p>

<p align="center">This project involved developing a web scraper in python to collect data from Drum Corps International (DCI), a world class competitive marching band competition. Data is severly incomplete and messy for the 2013 and 2014 competitions, so this scraper grabs everything from 2015 to today. After importing and cleaning the data in SQL, pandas and matplotlib is utilized to perform multivariate regression. This data is visualized in a compelling tableau dashboard which is available for public use in the drum corps community.</p>

</p>

<p align="center">For this project, I worked with a marketing team to segment customers based on their demographic and behavioral characteristics. I utilized clustering algorithms to group customers into distinct segments and provided actionable insights for targeted marketing campaigns. The results of this project led to a significant increase in customer engagement and higher conversion rates.</p>

</p>

<p align="center">In collaboration with an industrial manufacturing company, I developed a predictive maintenance model to reduce equipment downtime and maintenance costs. By analyzing historical sensor data and implementing machine learning techniques, I built a model that accurately predicted equipment failures, enabling the company to proactively schedule maintenance activities and optimize their operations.</p>
