## Projects

### Project 1: Customer Segmentation for Marketing Campaigns

![Project 1](https://your-project-image-url.com)
For this project, I worked with a marketing team to segment customers based on their demographic and behavioral characteristics. I utilized clustering algorithms to group customers into distinct segments and provided actionable insights for targeted marketing campaigns. The results of this project led to a significant increase in customer engagement and higher conversion rates.

This personal "just for fun" project involved developing a web scraper in Python (BeautifulSoup, Pandas) to collect data from Drum Corps International (DCI), a world-class competitive marching band competition. After we clean and analyze the data with SQL, we visualize our findings in PowerBI.
