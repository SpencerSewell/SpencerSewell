## Projects

### [Project 1: BellaBeat Fitbit Fitness Dashboard](https://github.com/SpencerSewell/FitBit-Fitness-Tracker-Excel-Dashboard)

![Project 1](https://github.com/SpencerSewell/Pictures/blob/main/BPhoto1.png)
This data set from Kaggle provided 3rd party fitbit data for a women's focused fitness company called BellaBeat. All data in this project is handled inside of Excel.

### [Project 2: Drum Corps International Web Scraper and Dashboard](https://github.com/SpencerSewell/DCI-Analysis)

This personal "just for fun" project involved developing my first ever web scraper in Python with BeautifulSoup to collect data from Drum Corps International (DCI), a world-class competitive marching band competition. After we clean up the data with SQL, we visualize in PowerBI.

### [Project 3: ISLR College Data Exploration in R](https://github.com/SpencerSewell/ISLR-College-Data-Exploration-in-R)
![Project 3](https://static.stacker.com/s3fs-public/styles/sar_screen_maximum_large/s3/2020-02/Columbia.png)
This project uses the College data set from the ISLR package, which provides data on enrollment and graduation rates between private and non private institutes. I use ggplot2 to visualize scatterplots and histograms, hypothesis testing of mean enrollment and mean graduation rates, and linear and multilinear regression models to predict if a school is private and to predict enrollment rates.


### [Project 4: Unifying Statistical Distributions](https://github.com/SpencerSewell/Unifying-Statistical-Distributions)

This was my undergraduate research project, where I explored the connections between univariate discrete and continuous models. It builds a fascinating roadmap that isn't typically taught in highschool/undergraduate statistics classes!
