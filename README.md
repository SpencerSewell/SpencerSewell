## Projects
### [Project 1: Drum Corps International Analysis](https://github.com/SpencerSewell/DCI-Analysis)

![Project 1](https://production.assets.dci.org/5d4d02cb694c8b0dc74209c2_-GcnYPzd3bm7L_r2bNgiLIPG9BW7YZ7J.jpg)
This project involved developing a web scraper in Python to collect data from Drum Corps International (DCI), a world-class competitive marching band competition. Data is severely incomplete and messy for the 2013 and 2014 competitions, so this scraper grabs everything from 2015 to today. Data is imported into a CSV for cleaning and analysis in SQL. This is visualized in a compelling Tableau dashboard for members of the community.

### Project 2: Customer Segmentation for Marketing Campaigns

For this project, I worked with a marketing team to segment customers based on their demographic and behavioral characteristics. I utilized clustering algorithms to group customers into distinct segments and provided actionable insights for targeted marketing campaigns. The results of this project led to a significant increase in customer engagement and higher conversion rates.

### Project 3: Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment

![Project 3](https://your-project-image-url.com)
In collaboration with an industrial manufacturing company, I developed a predictive maintenance model to reduce equipment downtime and maintenance costs. By analyzing historical sensor data and implementing machine learning techniques, I built a model that accurately predicted equipment failures, enabling the company to proactively schedule maintenance activities and optimize their operations.
